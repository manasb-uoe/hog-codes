title: Implement curry()
description: |
  Implement a function `curry` that takes a function `f` and returns a curried version of `f`. The curried version of `f` should take a single argument and return a new function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments are provided. Once all arguments are provided, the original function `f` should be called with those arguments and the result returned.

  &nbsp;

  Here is an example:

  &nbsp;

  ```javascript
  const join = (a, b, c) => {
   return `${a}_${b}_${c}`
  }
  const curriedJoin = curry(join)
  curriedJoin(1, 2, 3) // '1_2_3'
  curriedJoin(1)(2, 3) // '1_2_3'
  curriedJoin(1, 2)(3) // '1_2_3'
  ```
